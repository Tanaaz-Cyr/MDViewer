## Text-to-Speech Testing

Click on any word below to start reading from that position.

The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This sentence contains every letter of the alphabet. It's commonly used for testing fonts and text rendering.

### Accessibility Features

MDViewer was designed with accessibility in mind, particularly for users with dyslexia or other reading difficulties. The text-to-speech feature allows you to:

1. Select any starting point by clicking a word
2. Choose from multiple system voices
3. Adjust reading speed to your preference
4. See visual highlighting of the current line being read

### Table Example

Here's a table showing different speech rates:

| Rate (WPM) | Speed | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| 100-150 | Slow | Learning, Detailed Reading |
| 150-200 | Normal | General Reading |
| 200-250 | Fast | Quick Review |

You can test the TTS with different rates to find what works best for you!

### Instructions

1. Switch to the **MD Viewer** tab
2. Click on any word in this document
3. Select a voice (optional)
4. Adjust the speech rate (optional)
5. Click the **Speak** button
6. Observe the line highlighting as the text is read aloud

## Conclusion

We hope you find MDViewer useful for reading and editing markdown documents. The combination of editing, viewing, and text-to-speech makes it a powerful tool for both content creation and consumption.
